# Enhancements: User Stories

1. **Search or Filter Tasks**
   - *As a user*, I want to filter tasks by keyword or priority so that I can quickly find specific tasks when the list is large.

2. **Sort Tasks by Priority or Date**
   - *As a user*, I want to sort my tasks by due date or by priority, so I can see the most urgent tasks first.

3. **Pinned/Starred Tasks**
   - *As a user*, I want to pin certain tasks at the top of my list, so I can easily access the most important ones.

4. **Collapsible Subtasks**
   - *As a user*, I want to collapse or expand the subtasks section under each main task, so the interface remains clean and uncluttered.

5. **Progress Bar for Subtasks**
   - *As a user*, I want to see a quick progress bar (e.g., “3/5 subtasks complete”), so I can gauge how much is left.

6. **Task Categories/Labels**
   - *As a user*, I want to tag tasks with categories (e.g., “Work,” “Personal”) so I can visually group them.

7. **Inline Editing**
   - *As a user*, I want to edit a task’s text or date by clicking on it directly, so I don’t have to open a separate form.

8. **Drag and Drop Ordering**
   - *As a user*, I want to drag and drop tasks to reorder them, so I can prioritize tasks manually in a list.

9. **Push to Calendar**
   - *As a user*, I want to add a task with a due date to my Google Calendar or iCal, so I can integrate it into my daily schedule.

10. **Notifications for Subtasks**
    - *As a user*, I want to receive due notifications for subtasks, not just the main tasks, so I don’t miss smaller but critical steps.

11. **PWA (Progressive Web App)**
    - *As a user*, I want to install NeuroTask as an app on my phone (offline support, push notifications), so I can use it like a native mobile app.
